Lab 8

Purpose:

To learn to implement linked lists effectively and correctly. To provide more
practice with using pointers.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:

I learned how to implement a linked list data structure correctly and how to use
redirection for input, output, and appending. I also learned how to use malloc and
free inside of functions rather than exclusively in main.

b) Issues and How I fixed them:

I struggled with this lab. By now it's all pretty well put together but development was
very difficult and took longer than I expected. I had a hard time getting the order
of operations correct when freeing and adding nodes, as well as with correct order of
operations in terms of where to put while loops and if statements. Many of my most
infuriating bugs were usually do to a mismatch of order of operations. I fixed the
issues by drawing diagrams, running through the code over and over...and over again
in my head (testing the logic) and by getting help via tutoring in the computer lab.

c) Improvements that can be made:

I'd like to get rid of the compiler warning in the collatz program that says
the tail pointer is initialized but not used. It is used in printing the linked list,
but is never called explicitly.
