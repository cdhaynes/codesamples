# codesamples

This is a repository with code samples from academic projects I've worked on as an undergrad at New Mexico Tech.
Some notable projects are: 
    * a lisp interpreter written in Java
    * Clones of linux commands like "env" written in C
    * A Song Playing Program Written in Java
    
**Note, file hierarchy can be byzantine with the Java projects. Source Code is contained in "src" folders.
